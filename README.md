 The goal of this project is to train a lexical embedding model that integrates notions of synonymy and antonymy using neural networks.

Unlike the embeddings like Glove or Word2Vec, which often position words in equivalent proximity to their synonyms and antonyms, we will seek to make our models distinguish synonyms and antonyms, by bringing words closer to their synonyms and moving them away from their antonyms.
